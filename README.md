c) Introduction of the proposed mobile application.
    During the Covid-19 Pandemic, the number of people suffering from anxiety or depression is increasing. Malaysia had 468 suicidal thoughts in just the first five months of 2021, roughly equal to the annual number of suicides in 2020 and 2019.
    Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feels, and act as we cope with life. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood and aging.  	  
The increase in suicidal thoughts in Malaysia is caused by several factors such as fear, loneliness, overthinking, and boredom. Reaching out to a third party may be the trump card that will reverse the situation.

Our app aims to help individuals with mental health issues by increasing their awareness and providing them with meditations to help them overcome this problem.

Health, in general, is precious, priceless; however, it is vulnerable to many diseases, some of them can be cured by medicines but Poor Mental health in specific, needs guidance to find the determination needed to overcome it. We already lost too much because of that virus we can’t afford more casualties. Therefore, words must reach out to teenagers and adults in Malaysia, to light the candle of hope again and give them a new purpose in life.
