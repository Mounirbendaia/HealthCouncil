### c) Introduction of the proposed mobile application.<br>
During the Covid-19 Pandemic, the number of people suffering from anxiety or depression is increasing. Malaysia had 468 suicidal thoughts in just the first five months of 2021, roughly equal to the annual number of suicides in 2020 and 2019. Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feels, and act as we cope with life. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood and aging. The increase in suicidal thoughts in Malaysia is caused by several factors such as fear, loneliness, overthinking, and boredom. Reaching out to a third party may be the trump card that will reverse the situation.
