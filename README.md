### c) Introduction of the proposed mobile application.<br>
During the Covid-19 Pandemic, the number of people suffering from anxiety or depression is increasing. Malaysia had 468 suicidal thoughts in just the first five months of 2021, roughly equal to the annual number of suicides in 2020 and 2019. Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feels, and act as we cope with life. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood and aging. The increase in suicidal thoughts in Malaysia is caused by several factors such as fear, loneliness, overthinking, and boredom. Reaching out to a third party may be the trump card that will reverse the situation.
<br>
### d) Objective of the proposed mobile application.<br>
Our app aims to help individuals with mental health issues by increasing their awareness and providing them with meditations to help them overcome this problem.
The main significance of the project is to develop a platform that can help individuals with their mental health. 
	<br>
### e) Features and functionalities of the proposed mobile application.<br>
The platform will consist of a Homepage, Logging page. Information and Tips page that gives you various advice on how to reduce the issue. The meditation contains practical advice on how to replace sadness with a pragmatic and ultimately satisfying outlook on life.
